This project is a simplified, self-built version of the Redis in-memory database, written in Go. It was created as a learning exercise to understand how databases like Redis work internally. The project implements core Redis features such as RESP protocol handling, a variety of Redis commands, data persistence (RDB and AOF), transaction support, key eviction policies (LRU/LFU), and concurrency safety. It is fully configurable and can be run locally, allowing users to connect with any standard Redis client. The project is intended for educational purposes, experimentation, and as a resource for those interested in database internals or Go programming.
